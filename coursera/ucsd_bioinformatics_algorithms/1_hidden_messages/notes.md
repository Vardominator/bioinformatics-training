# final project
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can persist in latent state for years without causing disease. Latency has been linked hypoxia (lack of oxygen).
Genes that are activated in hypoxia are regulated by a common transcription factor. So you collect the upstream sequences for all of the MTB genes that are upregulated in hypoxia. You then look for the motif that corresponds to the binding site for the transcription factor regulating these genes.
This will be done by analzying the 250 bp upstream region of each gene.
